## What is object oriented programming?

Object oriented programming (OOP) is a computer model that organizes software design around data, or objects.
In other words it uses classes which contains data.

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

OOP concepts include;

-Abstraction, 
-encapsualtion,
-Inheritance,
-Polymorphism

These consepts lets us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security.

## What are the main principles of OOP?

The four main principles in OOP:
-Abstraction, 
-encapsualtion,
-Inheritance,
-Polymorphism

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within the unit.
It is often used to hide the internal representation, also called information hiding.

There are different types of encapsulation:
-Public
-Private
-Protected.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is more like a hosue that contains a lot of variables which is hidden under the same name. for example, the house; where you have a kitchen, living room etc... but look at it like code.

-Prevents code repetition
-improves flexibility
-working in large teams

## Inheritance

Inheritance is 
why? Modular codebase, code reusability and less development.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is another word for "many shaped" and it has two aspects:
*At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class in places such as method parameters and collections or arrays. 
*Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and implementation.
